**Author:** Mariam Olanipekun  
**Track:** Data Science  
**Project:** AltSchool of Data Science ‚Äì Tinyuka 2024  

## üîç Project Focus

This project simulates an A/B test using real news articles fetched via NewsAPI to determine if **headline length** or **sentiment** affects the **depth of health-related articles**.

### Key Questions:
- Do shorter or longer health headlines produce deeper articles?
- Does the emotional tone (sentiment) of headlines influence article length?

## üìÅ Project Contents

- `Mariam_Olanipekun2Exam.ipynb`: Full analysis notebook
- Mariam_Olanipekun2Exam.docx: Formal written summary of the project
- `health_clean_articles.csv`: Cleaned dataset used in the notebook
- 'health_raw_articles.csv: dataset used in the notebook

## ‚úÖ How to Use

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Run the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter, VSCode, or Google Colab
3. Make sure `health_clean_articles.csv` is in the same folder

## üìå Summary of Findings

- No statistically significant difference between long and short headlines in article depth.
- Sentiment also did not significantly influence content length.
- Real-world data challenges (e.g., API limits, missing fields) made the experience more practical.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The project uses static data saved from the NewsAPI, as API results may change over time.
